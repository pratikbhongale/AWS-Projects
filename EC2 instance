This repository documents the process of setting up an EC2 instance on AWS using Ubuntu as the operating system (AMI) to host a website. The project covers the following steps:
Launching an EC2 instance
Installing Apache2 web server
Setting up a website
Checking the server status and accessing the website via the public IP address

**Project Overview**
The goal of this project was to create an EC2 instance, configure it to serve a website using the Apache2 web server, and verify that the website is accessible from the public IP address.
Tools & Services Used
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Ubuntu (AMI)
Apache2 Web Server
HTTP Protocol (Port 80)

**Creating an EC2 Instance**
Step 1: Launch an EC2 Instance
Sign in to your AWS Management Console.
Navigate to EC2 Dashboard.
Click on Launch Instance.
In the Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) section, select the Ubuntu AMI (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 LTS).
In the Choose an Instance Type section, select the appropriate instance type (e.g., t2.micro for testing).
Configure instance details, storage, and security group.
Ensure the security group allows inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and port 22 (SSH).
Review your configurations and click Launch.
Select or create a new key pair to access your EC2 instance and click Launch Instances.

**Access the EC2 Instance via SSH**
Once your instance is running, connect to it using SSH with the following command:
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip

**Installing Apache2**
Step 1: Update the Ubuntu Instance
Update the package lists for the most recent versions of the repositories:
sudo apt update

**Step 2: Install Apache2 Web Server**
Install Apache2 using the following command:
sudo apt install apache2 -y

**Step 3: Start and Enable Apache2 Service**
Start the Apache2 service and enable it to start on boot:
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2

**4. Setting up a Website**
Step 1: Create a Simple HTML Website
You can place your website files in the Apache default directory, which is /var/www/html. Create a basic index.html file:
 /var/www/html/index.html
Step 2: Set Proper Permissions
Ensure Apache has the proper permissions to serve the files:
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html

**5. Accessing the Website**
Step 1: Verify Apache2 Status
To check if Apache2 is running properly, use the following command:
sudo systemctl status apache2
You should see an output indicating that the Apache service is active and running.

**Step 2: Access the Website via Public IP**
Using your EC2 instanceâ€™s public IP address, open a web browser and visit:
Copy
http://your-ec2-public-ip
